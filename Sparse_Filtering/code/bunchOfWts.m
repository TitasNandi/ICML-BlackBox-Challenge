% Generate a set of weights from sparse filter training using the bulk unlabeled
% data for the Kaggle Blackbox challenge. If feature_cts has length k, then
% the output is a k x 2 cell array with features for the ith filter in sets{i,1}
% and the weights in {i, 2}. The unlabeled data has a 5K row batch pulled
% databatch_ct times and run for iter iterations of the sparse filter training
% algorithm.
%
% Params:
%  feature_cts - vector of feature counts to use for each feature set.
%       e.g. [100 100 100] trains three sets of 100 features each.
%  databatch_ct - the number of times to sample the data batches
%  iter - the number of iterations sparseFiltering runs on each data batch.
%  write_features - (default true) If true, write the features to
%        a directory for R to pick them up in.
%  r_dir - the path to where the files should be written for R to get them,
%
% Return:
%  sets - a length(feature_cts) x 2 cell array in which the rows hold the 
%         features, weights and svm model for each feature set. 
%         The features of the kth set are in sets{k, 1} & the weights are
%         in sets{k, 2}.

% path to where you want to put the output features so that R can find them
