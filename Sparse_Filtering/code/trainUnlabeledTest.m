% trainUnlabeled trains a weight matrix on the unlabeled data in the Kaggle
% Blackbox challenge. 
%
% Params:
%   feature_ct - the number of features to have in this filter
%   blocks - b x 2 matrix where each row is a block. 
%     Each block has a start index and an iteration count.
%
% Return:
%   f - the features for xtrain evaluated on these weights
%   w - the weights learned
